Godot World assignment for CS517

## Purpose
This game was the version of 'Hello World' for game engine Godot and it's language.

## Original Game
The original 2D game instructions are: [2D First Godot Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

## Modifications
I've modified the game to do the following
  1) Have a 'Lives/Health' bar of 5 hits that decreases everytime a player is hit
  2) When hit, the player will recieve a one second 'invincibility' moving time
  3) When hit, the animation of the character will flash when moving around
  4) Added inputs in addition to the normal:
     - 'w' or 'W' for up
     - 'd' or 'D' for down
     - 's' or 'S' for left
     - 'a' or 'A' for right
